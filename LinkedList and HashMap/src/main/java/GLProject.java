/*

Description: I have implemented a simplified hash map (MyHashMap) and a generic queue (GenericQueue) in Java.
My GenericQueue relies on a linked list for managing elements and offers common queue operations such as enqueue and
dequeue. On the other hand, MyHashMap associates keys (strings) with generic values and uses an ArrayList to store queues
of key-value pairs, allowing for efficient data retrieval and insertion. To facilitate data traversal, I have also implemented
three iterators: GLLIterator, ReverseGLLIterator, and HMIterator. These iterators are designed to enable easy navigation of
the data structures. In addition, I have created a comprehensive set of JUnit test cases (GQTest and HMTest) to rigorously
test the functionality of both the data structures and the iterators. This code serves as a foundation for basic data structures
and iterators and ensures their reliability through thorough testing.
